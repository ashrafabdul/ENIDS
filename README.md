# ENIDS

This project contains the codebase for training and evaluation of Multi-Layer Perceptron and Multi-Task Learning model for Attack Category prediction on the NSL-KDD dataset. In addition to this, code for generating explanations using LIME and Integrated Gradients as well as a quantitative evaluation is present.

The codebase structure is as follows:<br/>
<b>-> dl:<\b> Model build and training<br/>
<b>-> eval:<\b> Quantitative evaluations for LIME and IG explanation techniques<br/>
<b>-> explainers:<\b> Implementation of LIME and IG explanations using external libraries<br/>
<b>-> pred:<\b> Model evaluation<br/>
<b>-> preproc:<\b> Data preprocessing<br/>
<b>-> utils:<\b> Helper functions for various operations<br/>
